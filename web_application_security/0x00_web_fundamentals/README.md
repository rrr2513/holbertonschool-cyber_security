Web Fundamentals
Core web application concepts and basic attack vectors. Understanding how web apps work before learning to break them.

Tasks
1-host_header_injection.sh - Host header manipulation
Exploiting how applications process HTTP Host headers. Can lead to cache poisoning, password reset bypass, or SSRF.

2-flag.txt - Challenge completion
Successfully exploited fundamental web vulnerability.

Concepts Covered
HTTP request/response structure
Header manipulation techniques
How web servers process requests
Basic web-based attack vectors
Client-server communication
Skills Applied
Understanding HTTP protocol internals, header injection, web application logic flaws. Foundation knowledge for more advanced web exploitation.

These fundamentals are essential - you can't exploit web apps effectively without understanding how they work at the protocol level.
